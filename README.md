# Learning-JS

## Goal

The Goal with this Repo is, that I want to learn Javascript!

## Projects

### Project 1

This was a very small project, in which I learned variables and some other stuff!

### Project 2

This project has a big learning curve for me! I made a number guessing game. You need to write a number between 1 and 100 and the site will tell you, if you are to high or to low!
